Wash the whole shoe with a brush that's not too hard, a small amount of hot water and some soap. 3. Remove as much water as possible from the inside using a towel. 4. To dry your shoes, try not to put them near a heat source (like on the radiator): they should be dried at room temperature. Open the shoes and stuff them with newspaper or kitchen roll. This will absorb the moisture present in the shoes. IMPORTANT... We advise you not to:put them in the tumble dryer, dry them in direct sunlight, use a hairdryer, put them next to a heat source (radiator, fireplace). It takes around twelve hours for a shoe to dry properly.

The first thing to do is to start by removing all visible dirt with a damp cloth. If you notice that this is not enough, it is advisable to use a can of compressed air(more often used for computers). This will allow you to remove any dry items such as dust that may have accumulated near the pivots in hard to reach places, something very important for the suspension system of a mountain bike, for example. In fact, performing these first two cleaning steps could help to limit certain noises that are often warning signs that it will eventually be necessary to completely dismantle the system to clean it thoroughly.",

So that your new bike does not age too quickly or that your old bike remains your faithful companion, it must be cleaned and maintained regularly. Dirt caused by bad weather, road residues or dust in general can have an abrasive action on the parts of your bike and can alter the performances of this one.

For this the method is simple, it is necessary to clean his bike according to the rhythm of its outputs and then lubricate the appropriate parts before leaving. For intensive use mountain bike or racing bike, it is advisable to clean your bike after each ride. Indeed, if only to store the bike at home, it often needs to go through the cleaning box. For normal uses, the regular aspect of the cleaning is taken into account, if you take the bike every day wash it every week, if you take it only a few times a week, clean it every month and so on. The goal is to avoid too much accumulation over a long period.",

Tip:If you run often, we recommend that you use two pairs of shoes in winter so that you have spare pair for when one pair is drying.Your shoes may need even more care in winter. If you take care of them properly, they will last longer. After running in the rain or snow, clean them with a cloth and remove the insoles if you can. Stuff them with newspaper, to absorb the moisture inside the shoe.Have a good cleaning !",

        advice_content:"Runners have a special relationship with their shoes. They accompany the runner throughout their training sessions and races. This is why shoes must be properly taken care of so that they can be kept longer. May people mistakenly wash their shoes in the machine, which damages the technical and physical properties of the shoe, and can lead to unsticking, shrinking or ripping of the seams on the shoe's upper. We therefore recommend that you wash them as soon as they are very dirty (mud) with soapy water and a small synthetic brush. Definitely no bleach! Rinse with warm water. YOU CAN WASH THEM BY HAND WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS. 1. If possible, remove the insole* by pulling it out of the shoe, then wash it separately. 2. Wash the whole shoe with a brush that's not too hard, a small amount of hot water and some soap. 3. Remove as much water as possible from the inside using a towel. 4. To dry your shoes, try not to put them near a heat source (like on the radiator): they should be dried at room temperature. Open the shoes and stuff them with newspaper or kitchen roll. This will absorb the moisture present in the shoes. IMPORTANT... We advise you not to:put them in the tumble dryer, dry them in direct sunlight, use a hairdryer, put them next to a heat source (radiator, fireplace). It takes around twelve hours for a shoe to dry properly.

It is advisable to use a stable work surface such as a table to maintain your road bike. This reduces the risk of losing parts (and it's much more comfortable). Depending on your use, the complete maintenance of your road bike should be done at least once every two years. If you have used it often in more difficult conditions, do the deep cleaning once a year.",

          advice_content:"In the same way as the frame, there may be dirt that has become embedded in the moving parts of the bike. The first thing to do is to start by removing all visible dirt with a damp cloth. If you notice that this is not enough, it is advisable to use a can of compressed air(more often used for computers). This will allow you to remove any dry items such as dust that may have accumulated near the pivots in hard to reach places, something very important for the suspension system of a mountain bike, for example. In fact, performing these first two cleaning steps could help to limit certain noises that are often warning signs that it will eventually be necessary to completely dismantle the system to clean it thoroughly.",
